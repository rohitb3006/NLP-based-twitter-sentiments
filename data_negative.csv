1879,"@RoshanRaj08 @OfficialDMRC terminating*. Right next to the tracks of west rail line, there‚Äôs another west rail line track, like side platforms. Both platforms are used alternatively by west rail line. You‚Äôll see this in the video."
1882,"@RoshanRaj08 @OfficialDMRC I‚Äôll have to look. It‚Äôs anyway the old platforms, not used anymore (since last month). There was a 5th platform near to this which was intercity through trains which went to China, sharing tracks with East Rail Line at times. Let me find a good YouTube video."
1884,"@RoshanRaj08 @OfficialDMRC Tuen Ma line terminates at Central, and does this too. Has two platforms for it, island. One train comes, waits a long time, another comes, this leaves later.

1900,@aarnavg17 @OfficialDMRC I think the plan is to have it underground. But elevated platforms will be better for interchange.
1903,@aarnavg17 @OfficialDMRC Atleast the platform should be directly below the existing Red Line one even if it is 2 level below.
1905,@RoshanRaj08 @OfficialDMRC I don‚Äôt really think we‚Äôll be having a good interchange at Inderlok anymore though.
1907,"@RoshanRaj08 @OfficialDMRC Yep. Space is going to be challenge, the current platform goes long and perpendicular, creating a hurdle. One way would be to create it above the red line platforms, if that‚Äôs somehow doable. As long as they do it and not create a new line."
1909,"@RoshanRaj08 @OfficialDMRC Then they shifted East Rail Line one level below the new connected Tuen Ma line for a *super important* extension alignment. This extension of 2 stations costed them sharp curves, reducing train‚Äôs existing 12 coaches to a maximum of 9."
1910,"@RoshanRaj08 @OfficialDMRC Why did Hong Kong do it? They joined two lines into one by creating 4 stations in middle (my Silver-Grey and Brown-Green hope), so had to change direction of the train as it was on level and in between two East Rail Line tracks."
